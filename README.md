IRISH LIT AUTOTWEETS generate.py SCRIPT
=======================================

v1.3: 7 October 2015

This script generates the content of the [@IrishLitTweets](http://twitter.com/IrishLitTweets) Twitter account. There's a [general overview](http://patrickbrianmooney.nfshost.com/~patrick/projects/IrishLitTweets/) and a [more technical write-up](http://patrickbrianmooney.nfshost.com/~patrick/projects/IrishLitTweets/technical.html). This script's extra material is currently left behind to be periodically posted to the [Automated Irish Literature Discourses](http://autoirishlitdiscourses.tumblr.com/) Tumblr account; there's [a separate script](https://github.com/patrick-brian-mooney/IrishLitDiscourses-python) that handles that process.

This script is a replacement for my earlier [generate.sh bash script](http://patrickbrianmooney.nfshost.com/~patrick/projects/IrishLitTweets/generate.sh), which previously generated the script's content. I re-wrote it in Python both because I needed a Python project as I learn the language and because doing so will make it easier to continue to develop and maintain the script in the future. Bash is an ugly and awkward language for scripting.

This script works for me, but you'll have to adapt it to your own needs. I explicitly disclaim all resposibility for what happens if you adapt it and/or use it in your own circumstances.
