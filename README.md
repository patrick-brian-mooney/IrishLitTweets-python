IRISH LIT AUTOTWEETS generate.py SCRIPT
=======================================

v1.1: 22 September 2015

This script generates the content of the (@IrishLitTweets)[http://twitter.com/IrishLitTweets] Twitter account. It's a replacement for my earlier (generate.sh bash script)[http://patrickbrianmooney.nfshost.com/~patrick/projects/IrishLitTweets/generate.sh], which previously generated the script's content. There's a (general overview)[] and a (more technical write-up)[], both of which are now somewhat outdated, because this script is being used instead. They'll be updated in the nearish future, but in the meanwhile, they should still be a fair basic introduction to what's going on.

I re-wrote it in Python both because I needed a Python project as I learn the language and because doing so will make it easier to continue to develop and maintain the script in the future. Bash is an ugly and awkward language for scripting.

This script works for me, but you'll have to adapt it to your own needs. I explicitly disclaim all resposibility for what happens if you adapt it and/or use it in your own circumstances.
